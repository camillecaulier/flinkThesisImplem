To use a broadcast function to decide when to change the parallelism for the downstream operator, you can broadcast control signals from a higher-level operator and consume these signals in the downstream operator. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

// Broadcast the control stream
        BroadcastStream<ControlSignal> broadcastControlStream = controlStream.broadcast(new MapStateDescriptor<>(
                "ControlSignalState",
                String.class,
                ControlSignal.class
        ));

        // Consume the broadcasted control signals to adjust parallelism
        DataStream<Tuple2<String, Integer>> aggregate = split
                .keyBy(value -> value.f0)
                .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(5)))
                .process(new MaxPartialWindowProcessFunction())
                .connect(broadcastControlStream)
                .process(new ParallelismControlFunction());
